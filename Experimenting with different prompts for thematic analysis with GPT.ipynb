I received a letter saying they hadnt tested the sample for cell changes as there was no high risk HPV in the sample. I could have told them that was the case if they asked me as I havent had sex for 20 years. What a waste of time and money for everyone involved.' 'Had an NHS letter stating due for a smear. Called Dr booked up smear for that day wanted at surgery nearest to me. Called to me by phone said nurse was not available so had to go to next surgery further away. Had 4:30an start following morning to work but went to appointment at 5:20 pm day before it was a wet day ask husband give a lift cost him petrol money and had get long bus ride back. Just saw me after 5min wait said not due smear test till 2025 last one was 2020 and if I do have a test it would not be accurate. Very annoyed time not having to travel in cold wet weather could went bed early next working day. Why send nhs letter for smear when not due one nurse stated was over 50 and all my past test were ok nurse said I thought this reason made no sense as cancer can come when it wants. Whole even wasted. When could of been at home.' 'My mum aged 85 moved house to be close to me and in the last 5 months she has received 2 letters inviting her to a cervical screening. We ignored the first letter but when the second arrived I called the GP as there is no contact number or address on the letter. GP receptionist advised they cannot do anything and have no number for the admin dept of this. Its so laughable because not only is my mum 85 by she had a full Hysterectomy 40 years ago. If anyone can contact me with details how I can get in touch with this dept. I would appreciate it as I feel this stresses my mum out and also it is such a waste of NHS resources.' 'I had a gynaecology appointment yesterday regarding unexplained bleeding and possible polyps which Ive had before. The gynaecologist queried why I hadnt had a smear since 2016 so I said I thought I had but its transpired after speaking to my drs surgery that I havent had one. I always make an appt as soon as I receive a letter because I had laser surgery for precancerous cells when I was younger, plus cysts removed and in 2022 polyps removed. Im extremely concerned that I received no letter and am now 2 years overdue for a smear!! Really bad service!' 'Im very angry and upset with the service because Im a post op trans women and I dont need this service because I dont have a cervix or related things I think that there is a serious failure in the system somewhere sort it out now' 'Had a hysterectomy 7 years ago, they took everything and I still keep getting personal reminders to book cervical screening appointment…this is after I spoke to the GP practice who said Id been taken of the CS system and wouldnt hear anything else as I dont have a cervix anymore, instead I keep getting very annoying letters telling me that I am being invited to a screening appointment! Someone sort this out, its wasting resources unnecessarily, which the NHS can ill afford to do!' 'Every year I get two or three reminders for a cervical screening, even though I am not due my next one till 2024. I have written to the service and let my doctor know but nothing happens. This is such a waste of NHS money. Many of the reviews are saying the same thing so the costs of this poor admin are ones that the NHS cant afford to lose.' 'I have just received a second letter encouraging me to go for cervical screening as offered to those between 25 and 64 I am 67 and the records should reflect the fact that I had a full hysterectomy in 2012 I am therefore over the prescribed age for the procedure and it is totally unnecessary as there is nothing left to screen! This is not the first time that I have found that the records of my medical history are completely lacking in essential fact.' 'Despite being over the age limit for standard screening, the service wrote asking me to book an appointment in July 2020. And again in October 2021. I filled out the \"self cease form\" on this website in Nov 2021. Today in August 2022 you invited me again with a PA 1 letter to book a test and my GP practice also contacted me by text. I dont know what else I can do to avoid a repeat. I havent got younger so your invite for this service should have stopped when I passed age 64. It is very disappointing to know that you did not automatically stop sending letters due to my age excluding me and then also not to implement my \"self cease\" instruction when you repeated the invite when I was aged 66. I know times have been difficult but these are very basic issues. This is a waste of precious NHS resources.' 'There are reasons why some women may wish to contact the csas (this review will not accept organisation abbreviation in capital letters) but they are unable to do so, because online contact details are omitted. Where prior information and circumstance has been given to the csas in relation to screening invitation, it would be desirable if the organisation were to respect that information. Furthermore, at this time there are many issues of difficulty for patient access, trust and continuity of care at primary care level: the address of these factors may help to increase engagement of screening programmes. The unsolicited communication received from csas today will be shredded.' 'I had a total hysterectomy 5 years ago and each year I still receive a letter inviting me for a cervical screening. This is slightly annoying/upsetting as I no longer have a cervix. There is no simple way to contact the administration other than by post. It is not actually obvious that any letter I send will get to a real person. Please rectify this as I can not be the only person in this situation.' \n"]}],"source":["drive.mount('/content/drive',force_remount=True)\n","\n","# After mounting, you can access files in Google Drive like this:\n","\n","file_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/cervical.txt'\n","\n","\n","def read_and_concatenate(file_path):\n","    try:\n","        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n","            # Read the entire file and replace newline characters with spaces\n","            concatenated_string = file.read().replace('\\n', ' ')\n","            return concatenated_string\n","    except FileNotFoundError:\n","        return \"File not found.

This includes individuals\n","who:    - Have not been sexually active for an extended period.    -\n","Are over the age limit for the screening.    - Have had a\n","hysterectomy, thus no longer possessing a cervix.    - Are post-\n","operative trans women without a cervix.    - Have been previously\n","informed they are not due for a screening until a later date.  2.\n","**Waste of Resources**: A significant concern across multiple reviews\n","is the perceived waste of NHS resources due to unnecessary screening\n","invitations. Patients express frustration over the costs associated\n","with sending out irrelevant letters and the potential waste of medical\n","professionals' time.  3. **Lack of Accurate Medical Records**: There\n","is a recurrent theme of inaccurate or outdated medical records,\n","leading to inappropriate screening invitations. Patients mention their\n","medical histories, such as previous surgeries (e.g., hysterectomies)\n","and age, not being correctly reflected in the invitations they\n","receive.  4. **Communication Barriers**: Reviews frequently cite\n","difficulties in communicating with the responsible administrative\n","departments to correct errors or update information. Patients\n","highlight the absence of direct contact information and the\n","inefficiency of existing channels (such as GP practices) in resolving\n","their issues.  5. **Emotional Distress**: The receipt of unnecessary\n","screening invitations causes emotional distress for some individuals.\n","This ranges from annoyance and inconvenience to more substantial\n","upset, particularly for those reminded of past surgeries or those\n","transitioning/transitioned genders.  6. **Systemic Failure**: There is\n","an overarching theme of systemic failure within the cervical screening\n","invitation process. Patients suggest a breakdown or lapse in the\n","system's ability to accurately identify and invite eligible\n","individuals while excluding those for whom the screening is not\n","applicable.  7. **Desire for Improved Engagement and Trust**: Some\n","reviews express a wish for better engagement practices and a\n","restoration of trust in the healthcare system. Suggestions include\n","respecting previously submitted information and addressing broader\n","issues of access, trust, and continuity of care to improve\n","participation in screening programs.  These themes collectively\n","suggest areas for significant improvement within the cervical\n","screening invitation process, including the need for updated and\n","accurate medical records, more effective communication channels, and a\n","more patient-centered approach to healthcare invitations.\n","\n"]}],"source":["\n","from openai import OpenAI\n","\n","client = OpenAI()\n","\n","completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n"," #  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n","   temperature=0.7,  # Adjust the temperature as needed\n","   model= \"gpt-4-0125-preview\",\n","   messages=[\n","                {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": context_prompt},\n","                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": query}\n","              ]\n",")\n","\n","answer2 = completion.choices[0].message.content\n","formatted_text = textwrap.fill(answer2, width=70)\n","\n","print(f'ChatGPT Answer: {formatted_text}\\n')\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1JgH8xr3AZSdu86SOulpufPnac1XEtGJb","timestamp":1707917574572},{"file_id":"1bIz5WkVNBnPlw-1cRbLCvA9GSPRpQJ9Q","timestamp":1707242286470}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
